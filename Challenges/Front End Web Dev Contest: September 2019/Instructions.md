# Instructions
Your job is to try and recreate what you see in the design prototype, by using only HTML & CSS (no frameworks or JavaScript).

# Problem solving
This is my procedures of work:
  1. Analysis of the design prototype.

  2. Identify the font family, color palette and take average measurement.
  3. Create a tree structure of the webpage.
  4. Start coding the HTML (content).
  5. Styling with CSS.
  6. Add extra stuff like: shadow, simple button hover animation and Forget password's webpage.
  7. Use of [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

**Note01:** I have used documentations like [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).

**Note02:** I've used [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) as a code formatter under [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

# Conclusion
At the first sight it looks so simple, but once I've started to work I faced some problems that challenge my mind and help me train my skills.

It took me a whole day (11 Sep. 2019) to finish it, very beneficial. Feedbacks about my mistakes and best practices are much appreciated.

Thanks for reading ðŸ™‚
