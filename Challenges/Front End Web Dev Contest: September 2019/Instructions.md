2. Identify the font family, color palette and take average measurement
3. Create a tree structure of the webpage
4. Start coding the content HTML
5. Styling with CSS
6. Add extra stuff like: shadow, simple button hover animation and Forget password's webpage
7. Use of [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

**P.S**. I have used documentations like [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

It took me a whole day to finish, very beneficial. Feedbacks about my mistakes and best practices are much appreciated.
